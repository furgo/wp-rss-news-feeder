## 🚦 Learning Path

### Beginner Path 🟢
1. Start with [Simple Plugin](simple-plugin.md)
2. Add [Settings](settings.md) to your plugin
3. Learn basic [Testing](testing.md)

### Intermediate Path 🟡
1. Build an [Advanced Plugin](advanced-plugin.md)
2. Master [Service Providers](service-providers.md)
3. Implement [Events](events.md)

### Advanced Path 🔴
1. Study all [Service Provider](service-providers.md) patterns
2. Implement comprehensive [Testing](testing.md)
3. Build cross-plugin [Event](events.md) systems

## 📋 Quick Decision Guide

### "I need to build a simple admin tool"
→ Start with [Simple Plugin](simple-plugin.md) + [Settings API](settings.md)

### "I'm building a complex e-commerce extension"
→ Use [Advanced Plugin](advanced-plugin.md) + [Service Providers](service-providers.md)

### "I want to make my plugin extensible"
→ Implement [Event System](events.md) + study [Service Providers](service-providers.md)

### "I need to ensure code quality"
→ Follow [Testing](testing.md) guide + implement CI/CD

### "I'm refactoring a legacy plugin"
→ Start with [Service Providers](service-providers.md) for gradual migration

## 💡 General Best Practices

### Start Small
- Begin with minimal functionality
- Add complexity gradually
- Refactor as you learn

### Think Modular
- One feature = one Service Provider
- Keep services focused
- Use events for communication

### Test Early
- Write tests as you code
- Test the happy path first
- Add edge cases gradually

### Document as You Go
- PHPDoc all public methods
- README for each feature
- Examples in your docs

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. **Planning Phase**
- Define plugin requirements
- Choose architecture (simple vs advanced)
- Plan Service Providers
- Design event flows

### 2. **Implementation Phase**
- Create plugin structure
- Implement Service Providers
- Add WordPress integration
- Build features incrementally

### 3. **Testing Phase**
- Write unit tests
